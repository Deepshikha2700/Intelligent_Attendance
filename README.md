# Intelligent_Attendance
In this python project, we have made an attendance system which takes attendance by using face recognition technique. We have also integrated it with GUI (Graphical user interface) so it can be easy to use by anyone. GUI for this project is also made on python using tkinter.
Facial recognition software affords employers a means of tracking their employees' attendance while eliminating human error. This means keeping track of the exact amount of hours an employee is working and correlating payroll calculations. No “false overtime” to worry about
